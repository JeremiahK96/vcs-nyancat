Controller auto-detection will happen once for each player
in the main menu.

After the game starts, Player 1 is prompted to press the
fire button. The game is now in "controller detect mode".
First, INPT4 is checked. If the left joystick's fire button
is pressed, joystick mode is selected.

Otherwise, the paddle capacitor is dumped, and INPT0 is
immedeately checked. If a paddle is suspected here,
joystick mode is forced instead. This allows Genesis type
controllers to be detected for joystick mode.

Two frames later, the capacitor is checked again. If
joystick mode was suspected before, but paddle mode is now,
then and ONLY then, the first paddle in port 1's fire
button is checked. If pressed, paddle mode is selected.
Otherwise, it keeps looping until detection.

If Player 1 selects 2-player mode, after he selects the
"NEXT" option on the menu, Player 2 is prompted to press
the fire button.

First, Player 1's fire button is checked, and if it has
been released and pressed again, the menu goes back to
Player 1's menu options. This way, if a single player
accidentally selects 2-player mode with only one controller
attached, the game won't be completely frozen.

The next step works exactly the same as for Player 1, except
that INPT1 is also checked, in case both players are playing
with paddles.
